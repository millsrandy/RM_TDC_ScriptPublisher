# RM_TDC_ScriptPublisher
 TDC_ScriptPublisher

This is a Script Publisher for the TDC Pipeline developed in Allan McKay's TDC course.  This is my final project for the course.  It is currently WIP.

To-Do List:
	
	- NEED TO FIX - version checking on multiple folders/files, right now keeps resetting variable
	
	- NEED TO FIX - too many GLOBAL variables, need to rewrite some of the code to clean this up, (use structs instead?)

	- ADD: "Import Files" button to ScriptDepot that will force popup of ScriptPub
	
	- ADD: Check if PUB-TOOLS exists, ask user where PUB-TOOLS is located, if it doesn't exist ask if they'd like to create a PUB-TOOLS folder
	
	- ADD: package MISSING assets (bmp & txt) with final distro

REQUIRES:

    - lib_CharChange.ms
    - lib_VerCheck.ms
    - lib_ Stream_File.ms
    - lib_SearchStringBlock.ms
    - lib_TextWrap.ms
