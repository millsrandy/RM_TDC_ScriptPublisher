 TDC_ScriptPublisher

This is a Script Publisher for the TDC Pipeline developed in Allan McKay's TDC course.  This is my final project for the course, written from scratch.

It is currently WIP.

To-Do List:
    - NEED TO FIX - version checking on multiple folders/files, right now keeps resetting variable

	- ADD: "Import Files" button to ScriptDepot that will force popup of ScriptPub
	
	- ADD: Check if PUB-TOOLS exists, ask user where PUB-TOOLS is located, 
	if it doesn't exist ask if they'd like to create a PUB-TOOLS folder
	
	- ADD: package MISSING assets (bmp & txt) with final distro

    - lib_CharChange.ms
    - lib_VerCheck.ms
